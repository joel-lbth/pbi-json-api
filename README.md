# pbi-json-api
> a demo dashboard that pulls data from a JSON api endpoint

[![screenshot of dashboard](screenshot-dashboard.png)](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/0b4d5a6e-774c-4f9c-bc42-fbcb35e1c483/reports/8b55434a-ed08-42c1-9761-a35e6437afdc/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)

in this instance the data was found in json pulled by pages for [victoria park](https://aqicn.org/city/united-kingdom/tower-hamlets-victoria-park/) ([json](https://api.waqi.info/api/feed/@14598/aqi.json)) and [blackwall](https://aqicn.org/city/united-kingdom/tower-hamlets-blackwall/) ([json](https://api2.waqi.info/api/feed/@7948/aqi.json))

the api is undocumented, but relatively intuitive; a truncated sample is shown below, with the `obs` and `forecast` sections removed for brevity:

adding these as data sources in pbi (Aug 2023 version) was quite easy, it automated most of the flattening process, turning the json blob into a wide table comprised of a single row, mainly making use of the `Table.ExpandRecordColumn` function to break out json object properties into named columns.

the out-of-the-box powerquery was only modified in one place, to split a json array into named longitude and latitude columns via transform, split, and rename calls:

```m
#"Extracted Values" = Table.TransformColumns(#"Expanded rxs.obs.msg.city", {"rxs.obs.msg.city.geo", each Text.Combine(List.Transform(_, Text.From), ","), type text}),
#"Split Column by Delimiter" = Table.SplitColumn(#"Extracted Values", "rxs.obs.msg.city.geo", Splitter.SplitTextByDelimiter(",", QuoteStyle.Csv), {"rxs.obs.msg.city.geo.1", "rxs.obs.msg.city.geo.2"}),
#"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Split Column by Delimiter",{{"rxs.obs.msg.city.geo.1", "latitude"}, {"rxs.obs.msg.city.geo.2", "longitude"}}),
```

the resulting datasets were then piped into "multi row card" and map visuals in the board itself.

## use of pbi-tools

this project uses [pbi.tools](https://pbi.tools) to bring reliable versioning and documentation support.

a few of the more useful commands are explained below:

`pbi-tools extract pbi-json-api.pbix`

> Extract the contents of a PBIX/PBIT file into a folder structure suitable for source control.

...you can then work on powerquery directly in a code editor, useful for managing complex products where you need to find/replace across multiple pages.

`pbi-tools compile pbi-json-api -overwrite -format PBIT`

> re-compile a PBIT file from modified sources in the specified folder

...having fixed up your powerqueries, you can recompile these back into a PBIT, which in turn you can open in pbi, ready to save as a PBIX report...

`pbi-tools launch-pbi pbi-json-api.pbit`

> open a pbit in pbi

...this file can then be saved as pbix format and published!
